        To provide joint work in the team and separate tasks we used Jira dashboard. We decomposited tasks to clearly
        define goals and noted them to understand who is working on what. Each pull request was checked and approved by
        teammates. We made calls to analize tasks and take them on. To notify about a new pull-request, solve short
        problems quickly or share useful information we corresponded in chat. It was also useful because most of
        teammates are really busy. In the end we've got this app for your assessment!{' '}
